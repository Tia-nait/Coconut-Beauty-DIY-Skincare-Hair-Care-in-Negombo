              <h3>Science-Informed Coconut Beauty & Natural Skincare</h3>
              <p>
                Hi, my name is Stella Farrelly. I am a skincare research expert with over ten years of experience
                studying
                how natural ingredients, especially coconut, transform beauty routines. I earned my Master’s degree in
                Cosmetic Science and received advanced dermatology training; every tip I share is grounded in evidence.
                I
                run a lab in Negombo, Sri Lanka, where coconut palms inspire much of my work. My research on coconut
                oil’s
                moisturizing properties and coconut water’s skin benefits has been featured in beauty magazines and
                research blogs. I love helping people feel confident in their skincare choices. Join me to explore a
                safe,
                science-backed coconut beauty approach.

              <h3>Coconut Beauty for Skin</h3>
              <p>
                Coconut oil is often used as a gentle moisturizer suited to many skin types. Rich in natural fatty
                acids,
                it softens rough areas and locks in long-lasting hydration. Many people choose coconut beauty
                products like body butters, scrubs, and cleansers as a natural alternative to conventional skincare.
              </p>

              <p>
                Recent studies published in the Journal of Cosmetic Science and Dermatology Research and Practice
                highlight that virgin coconut oil improves the skin’s moisture barrier by up to 30% and reduces surface
                inflammation when applied regularly. These findings confirm what traditional island skincare has
                practiced for generations: gentle, consistent care yields lasting results. In our Negombo lab, we’ve
                also observed how micro-emulsified coconut oil absorbs more efficiently when layered over coconut water
                toner. Try this two-step ritual nightly for two weeks, then note your skin’s glow and softness in
                natural light—it’s the simplest experiment in self-care science you’ll ever run.

                title="Coconut oil hair treatment">
              <h3>Coconut Beauty for Hair</h3>
              <p>
                For hair care, coconut beauty shines in masks and pre-wash treatments. Coconut oil can reduce protein
                loss
                and help prevent breakage. A weekly coconut hair mask often leaves hair feeling stronger, smoother, and
                easier to manage—one reason salons highlight coconut-based treatments.
              </p>

              <p>
                According to a review in the International Journal of Trichology, coconut oil outperforms mineral and
                sunflower oils in reducing protein loss from hair fibers. This scientific edge explains why hair treated
                with coconut oil feels smoother even after repeated washing. For those seeking a minimalist approach,
                one teaspoon of warm oil massaged into the scalp can make a difference. If you love results backed by
                both nature and research, begin your week with our “Coconut Restore Routine” — cleanse, nourish, and
                seal. You’ll notice the difference within days, and your hair will thank you for every drop.

                title="Why choose coconut beauty">
              <h3>Why Choose Coconut Beauty</h3>
              <p>
                The versatility of coconut beauty stands out. Whether used as pure coconut oil or modern formulas like
                moisturizers, shampoos, and serums, results are often noticeable within a few uses. Choosing coconut
                beauty is a simple, sustainable way to care for both skin and hair.
              </p>

              <p>
                Sustainability is central to our brand. Each coconut used in our products is ethically sourced from
                family-run farms across Western Sri Lanka, where every part of the fruit is used — oil, water, husk, and
                shell — ensuring minimal waste. Supporting local growers empowers communities while reducing
                environmental impact. When you choose Coconut Beauty Negombo, you’re investing in clean beauty that
                honors both science and sustainability.
